# Dash Docsets

My Dash (https://kapeli.com/dash) docsets. Let the buyer beware ⚠️;)

**The main difference** between the docsets hosted in this repo and the official dash & dash user contributed docsets is that _these docsets are generated from the master branch of each project_.

Note: It's expected that these docsets should also work in [Zeal](https://zealdocs.org/).

## Docset Feeds

[Dash]() and [Zeal]() can subscribe to the following feeds with a single click.

```bash
dash-feed://<URL encoded feed URL>
```
